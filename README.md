# backbone.extended
This simple tool just adds several missing basic features to Backbone

  * Add support fot PATCH method
  * Add close method on view to avoid zombies and memory leaks, based on this [article](https://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/09/15/zombies-run-managing-page-transitions-in-backbone-apps) and this [one](http://andrewhenderson.me/tutorial/how-to-detect-backbone-memory-leaks/)

Nota : Usage of a famous Backbone library is good way ([Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/), [LayoutManager](http://layoutmanager.org/), [Chaplin](http://chaplinjs.org/) ...)
